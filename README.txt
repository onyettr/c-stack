C Programming Exercises  - Stack

Introduction
	Simple stack implementation. It uses dynamic memory allocation
	for the Stack_t type called from an exposed StackCreate() function call. 
Files
  main.c		launches the test harness to execute the stack
  makefil1e             builds everything
  stack.c               stack implementation 
  stack.h               stack header file
  test01.c              test harness 
  test.h                test harness header
  trap.c                error trap handler
  trap.h                error trap handler header file

Build
  Simple type make

ToDo
  1) Convert to a standalone library - DONE
  2) Provide ability to have fixed size Stack as a build option.
